# 📊 Defect Correlation & Root Cause Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project is a **Power BI PBIP (Power BI Project)** designed to analyze **garments quality defects**, identify **defect correlations**, and support **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** across production units.

The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by linking **production stages, defect types, and operational factors**, helping quality and operations teams reduce recurring defects and improve overall efficiency.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Garments factories often face:
- Repeated quality defects
- Difficulty identifying root causes
- Siloed inspection and production data
- Delayed corrective actions

This dashboard addresses these issues by providing:
- Clear defect trend analysis
- Correlation between defects and processes
- RCA-focused visual insights

## 📈 Key Features
- 📌 Defect frequency and severity analysis  
- 🔗 Correlation between defect types and production stages  
- 🧠 Root Cause Analysis (RCA) views  
- 🏭 Unit
